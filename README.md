# AWS-CICD-with-Fargate-ECS-ECR-Docker



<h2>Description</h2>
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
It allows you to easily run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, 
and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. In this project, I deployed an application on AWS using Fargate mode, Docker image,
Amazon Elastic container registry (ECR), Code Pipeline & Load balancers.
